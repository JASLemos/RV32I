# RISC-V RV32I CPU for Academic Purposes

A simple, scalar, in order, 5 stage pipelined RISC-V RV32I CPU designed for academic purposes, synthesized in **Vivado Design Suite** for the **Artix-7 50T FPGA**. The CPU is described in **Verilog HDL** and includes the following key components:

- **Instruction Memory**: Synthesized as a **ROM** using Distributed Memory via Vivado IP Catalog.
- **Data Memory**: Synthesized as a **RAM** using BRAM cells via Vivado IP Catalog.
- **32x32 Register Bank**: Described in HDL and synthesized as a **Dual Port RAM** using Distributed Memory cells.

## Features

- **Static Branch Prediction**: Branches are resolved in the 3rd pipeline stage to minimize the critical path, ensuring branches always take **3 clock cycles** to complete.
- **No Memory-Mapped Peripherals**: The CPU does not include memory-mapped peripherals.
- **No Misaligned Memory Access Handling**: The Data Memory does not support misaligned memory access.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### **Memory Initialization**

- Contains `.coe` files used to initialize the **Instruction Memory**.
    
- These files store RISC-V assembly programs in a format compatible with Vivado IP Catalog.
    
- You can load these programs into the ROM during synthesis.
    

### **Vivado/CPU**

- Contains the **Vivado project files** for the CPU.
    
- Includes project settings, synthesized design, and implementation files.
    
- Use this folder to open and modify the project in Vivado.
    

### **constraints**

- Stores **FPGA constraint files** (e.g., `.xdc` files).
    
- Defines pin assignments, clock constraints, and other FPGA-specific settings for the Artix-7 50T.
    

### **src**

- Contains the **Verilog HDL source files** for the CPU.
    
- Includes the main CPU modules (e.g., ALU, control unit, pipeline stages) and the top-level design.
    

### **tests**

- Includes **testbenches** for verifying the functionality of the CPU.
    
- Use these files to run simulations in Vivado or other Verilog-compatible tools.

## Memory Initialization

The **Instruction Memory** is initialized using `.coe` files, which contain RISC-V assembly programs. These files are loaded into the ROM via Vivado IP Catalog.

---

## Pipeline Breakdown

The pipeline is divided into five stages, each implemented by a corresponding module:

1. **IFU (Instruction Fetch Unit)**
    
2. **IDU (Instruction Decode Unit)**
    
3. **EXU (Execution Unit)**
    
4. **MAU (Memory Access Unit)**
    
5. **WBU (Writeback Unit)**
    

Each module corresponds directly to one of the classic RISC-V pipeline stages: **Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Writeback**. To improve readability in the RTL code, all inputs and outputs of these modules are labeled with an **uppercase letter** indicating the pipeline stage they belong to. For example:

- `ALUResultE` → Indicates the ALU output in the **Execute Stage**.
    
- `PCD` → Indicates the Program Counter in the **Decode Stage**.
    

---

### Module Descriptions

#### **IFU (Instruction Fetch Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Fetches instructions from memory and manages the Program Counter (PC).
    
- **Components**:
    
    - **Program Counter (PC)**: Tracks the address of the next instruction to fetch.
        
    - **Instruction Memory**: Stores the program instructions.
        
    - **Stall and Flush Signals**: Handles pipeline hazards by stalling or flushing the pipeline when necessary.
        

---

#### **IDU (Instruction Decode Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Decodes the fetched instruction and generates control signals for the pipeline.
    
- **Components**:
    
    - **Main Decoder**: Reads the instruction fields and sends control signals to the rest of the pipeline.
        
    - **Register File**: Contains the 32x32 general-purpose registers.
        
    - **Sign Extender**: Extends immediate values to 32 bits for use in subsequent stages.
        

---

#### **EXU (Execution Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Executes arithmetic, logic, and memory address calculations.
    
- **Components**:
    
    - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs R-type instructions and calculates effective addresses for load/store instructions.
        
    - **Branch Unit**: Handles branch instructions and determines whether to take the branch.
        
    - **Adder**: Calculates jump/branch target addresses.
        
    - **Store Decoder**: Prepares data from `[rs2]` for store operations based on the instruction type.
        

---

#### **MAU (Memory Access Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Manages data memory access for load and store instructions.
    
- **Components**:
    
    - **Data Memory**: Stores data for load/store operations.
        
    - **Synchronous Read Operation**: The output of the Data Memory is directly passed to the **Writeback Stage**.
        

---

### **WBU (Writeback Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Writes results back to the register file.
    
- **Components**:
    
    - **4x1 Multiplexer**: Selects the value to write back to the register file. The inputs are:
        
        1. `ALUResult`: Result from the ALU.
            
        2. `Data Memory Output`: Data read from memory.
            
        3. `PC + 4`: Used for jump instructions.
            
        4. `PCTarget`: Used for `JALR` instructions.
            
    - **Load Decoder**: Handles the data read from the Data Memory, adjusting it according to the specific **Load instruction** (e.g., `LB`, `LH`, `LW`, etc.).

---

### **Hazard Control**

The processor also contains a Hazard Control Unit, which reads information from the pipeline stages, and solves RAW Data Hazards, Load Use Data Hazards and Control Hazards, where there are no Structural Hazards due to the pipeline being scalar and always in order.

- This project was developed as part of a Undergraduate Scientific Reasearch conducted at the Federal University of Itajubá, UNIFEI, in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil.

## Future Work

Future work for this project could be:

- Implementation of multiplication and division instructions present in the "M" extension (in progress).
- A Instruction Cache and Data Cache.
- Memory mapped peripherals.
- Exceptions handling and misaligned memory access.
- Dynamic Branch Prediction to minimize Branch penalty.

Another feature that could be implemented, would be to implement the Shift instructions using a Shift register instead of a Barrel Shifter in the ALU, which could reduce the critical path even further, at the cost of Stalls in the case of a Data Hazard involving the Shift instructions, since they would be a multicycle instruction in the pipeline.
